NoisyNeuron is an advanced AI-powered audio source separation application that uses **Markov Chain models** combined with spectral analysis to isolate individual instruments and vocals from mixed audio tracks. This project is designed as a comprehensive university-level implementation demonstrating machine learning concepts in audio processing.

## 🎵 Features

- **High-Quality Output**: Enhanced audio processing with noise reduction and quality improvement
- **Real-Time Processing**: Asynchronous processing with live progress updates
- **Multiple Format Support**: Input/output support for MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, M4A, AAC

### Advanced Features

- **User Management**: Authentication, project management, and processing history
- **RESTful API**: Complete API for integration and automation
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live processing status

## 🧠 How Markov Models Work in Audio Separation

### Theoretical Foundation

This project implements **Hidden Markov Models (HMM)** adapted for audio source separation:

1. **State Representation**: Audio features (MFCC, spectral characteristics) are quantized into discrete states
2. **Transition Modeling**: Markov chains model how audio characteristics evolve over time
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Different instruments exhibit unique transition patterns
4. **Probabilistic Separation**: Use learned patterns to identify and separate instrument-specific components

### Implementation Details

```python
# Simplified example of the Markov chain approach
class AudioMarkovChain:
    def __init__(self, order=2, n_states=16):
        self.order = order  # Memory length (n-gram)
        self.n_states = n_states  # Discrete states
        self.transition_matrix = np.zeros((n_states**order, n_states))
    
    def train(self, audio_files, instrument_type):
        # Extract features (MFCC, spectral)
        # Quantize into discrete states
        # Build transition matrix
        # Learn instrument-specific patterns
    
    def separate(self, mixed_audio):
        # Analyze input with trained model
        # Generate separation mask
        # Apply probabilistic filtering
        # Return separated audio
```

### Key Advantages

- **Pattern Learning**: Adapts to different musical styles and instruments
- **Context Awareness**: Considers temporal dependencies in audio
- **Probabilistic Approach**: Handles uncertainty and noise gracefully
- **Interpretable Results**: Provides confidence scores and pattern analysis
